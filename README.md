# Tent Protocol Schemas [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/tent/tent-schemas.png)](http://travis-ci.org/tent/tent-schemas)

This repository contains [JSON Schemas](http://json-schema.org/) for most of the
[Tent Protocol](http://tent.io). Currently they are used to generate
documentation examples. In the future they will also contain specifications for
all API endpoints in Tent so that clients can be implemented/updated
programmtically.

Tent post and profile info types should also be implemented as JSON schemas, the
schema for these definitions has yet to be defined.

## Contributions

Here are some things that need to be done:

- Fix errors in the schemas.
- Implement a version of JSON hyper schemas that defines API endpoints/actions.
- Write a schema for post type schemas.
- Write a schema for profile info type schemas.
